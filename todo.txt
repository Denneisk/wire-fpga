FPGA Entity:
  Features:
    HiSpeed links (memory gates?)
    String to memory and opposite

  Bugs:
    
  Test:
    Check for errors during compilation (Hasnt been tested, but is implemented now)
      Check that gates exist
      Check for out of bounds input/output
      Type Check
      Check that connections are valid (that the destination node exists)
      Check if gate is banned..?
    
    Permissions
      Download from friend
      -Friends can upload

    Looping
      Execution chips have some edge cases (they dont retrigger on change as some might expect)

    Bugs:

    Feedback:
      Click outside of "E" menu should save
      Feedback on writing wrong format (angle, vector)

      Copying should copy from center


FPGA Gates:
  Add CPU related gates (PC, various ALUs, ADDERS, etc)

FPGA Entity:
  Improve execution
  Optimize execution

  (Entity spikes after amount of time and errors)
      Fixed by removing spike limit, as it seems unavoidable
      This is probably why E2 limits OPS and not time
      
  Add e2 commands that can find fpgas
      check performance use


FPGA Tool:
  Be able to upload bigger than 64kb files

  FPGA Editor:
    Improve performance (only draw visible nodes)

    Shortcuts?
    Grid
    Undo
    Improve the guide on how to use

    Bugs:
      Copying and pasting will fail if nodes are not sequential
    

FPGA Gates:
  Maybe add the various "luxuries" that e2 have (changed and last notably)
  Should these have wildcard types? 
  (this is pretty fucking hard???)
