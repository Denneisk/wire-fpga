    Test using chips with multiple outputs
    Test to make sure that order is correct

    execution is broken


FPGA Editor:
  Features:
    Shortcuts?

  Bugs:
    Saving a file with capital letter fucks it up

  nice to have:
    remove data.UsedInputNames and data.UsedOutputNames from savedata, they can be inferred
