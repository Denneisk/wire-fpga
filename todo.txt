FPGA Entity:
  Features:
    Improve execution
    Optimize execution

    HiSpeed links (memory gates?)
    String to memory and opposite

  Bugs:
    
    
  Test:
    Check for errors during compilation (Hasnt been tested, but is implemented now)
      Check that gates exist
      Check for out of bounds input/output
      Type Check
      Check that connections are valid (that the destination node exists)
      Check if gate is banned..?
    


FPGA Tool:
  Add a cool animation to the toolgun

  Download from chip

  Be able to upload bigger than 64kb files

  FPGA Editor:
    Features:
      Improve performance (only draw visible nodes)

    Bugs:
      Saving a file with capital letter fucks it up
      sometimes nodes cant be removed
      cant create node on preopened tab

FPGA Entity:
  Add mechanism such that loops are possible

  (Entity spikes after amount of time and errors)
      Fixed by removing spike limit, as it seems unavoidable
      This is probably why E2 limits OPS and not time.

  more clear error messages, just for debugging

FPGA Tool:
  Be able to upload bigger than 64kb files

  FPGA Editor:
    Bugs:
      Copying and pasting will fail if nodes are not sequential
    Shortcuts?
    Grid
    Undo
    Improve the guide on how to use


FPGA Gates:
  Maybe add the various "luxuries" that e2 have (changed and last notably)
  Should these have wildcard types? 
  (this is pretty fucking hard???)
  figure out logic of how exactly a "last" gate should work, since its pretty complicated
