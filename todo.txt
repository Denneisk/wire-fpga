FPGA Entity:
  Features:
    Improve execution
    Optimize execution

    Add mechanism such that loops are possible

    Adv. Dupe

    HiSpeed links (memory gates?)
    String to memory and opposite

  Bugs:
    Multiply gate needs all inputs connected

    
  Test:
    Check for errors during compilation (Hasnt been tested, but is implemented now)
      Check that gates exist
      Check for out of bounds input/output
      Type Check
      Check that connections are valid (that the destination node exists)
      Check if gate is banned..?
    more clear error messages, just for debugging
      
    


FPGA Tool:
  Add a cool animation to the toolgun

  Download from chip

  Be able to upload bigger than 64kb files

  FPGA Editor:
    Features:
      Shortcuts?
      Grid
      Mark selection, move all gates (or delete all)
      copy paste (with compatible with selection)
      Undo

    Bugs:
      Saving a file with capital letter fucks it up
      sometimes nodes cant be removed

    nice to have:
      Improve the guide on how to use


FPGA Gates:
  Maybe add the various "luxuries" that e2 have (changed and last notably)
    Should these have wildcard types? 
    (this is pretty fucking hard???)
    figure out logic of how exactly a "last" gate should work, since its pretty complicated
