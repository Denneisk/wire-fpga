FPGA Entity:
  Features:
    Improve execution

  Bugs:
    Test using chips with multiple outputs
    Test to make sure that order is correct


FPGA Editor:
  Features:
    Shortcuts?

  Bugs:
    Saving a file with capital letter fucks it up
    Fix colors
    Fix chip size being wrong if output bigger than input

  nice to have:
    remove data.UsedInputNames and data.UsedOutputNames from savedata, they can be inferred


FPGA Gates:
  Features:
    Add all types of input / output chips
