FPGA Entity:
  Features:
    Branching
    Only trigger if output changed (is this possible?)
    2 inputs with same name should just share input point
    Timed empty gate

  Bugs:
    Sometimes average spikes
    
  Test:
    Check for errors during compilation (Hasnt been tested, but is implemented now)
      Check that gates exist
      Check for out of bounds input/output
      Type Check
      Check that connections are valid (that the destination node exists)
      Check if gate is banned..?



FPGA Tool:
  FPGA Editor:
    Features:
      Global copy paste buffer
      Grid

    Bugs:
      Error if renaming open file, and trying to refresh

    Feedback:
      Feedback on writing wrong format (angle, vector)


FPGA Gates:
  Add CPU related gates (PC, various ALUs, ADDERS, etc)
    Adder / Half Adder
    Program counter
    Full ALU? might be too much
    Register

    4/8/16 bit increment
    4/8/16 bit not
    4/8/16 bit and
    4/8/16 bit or
    4/8/16 bit xor

  HiSpeed links (memory gates?)
    Wirelinks already work
    "Wrapper" fpga highspeed device?
      Define ranges that memory is routed through
      Or single values
      How to signify that a link is highspeed? Pseudo type?


  (Entity spikes after amount of time and errors)
      Fixed by removing spike limit, as it seems unavoidable
      This is probably why E2 limits OPS and not time
      
  Add e2 commands that can find fpgas
      check performance use


FPGA Tool:
  Be able to upload bigger than 64kb files

  FPGA Editor:
    Improve performance (only draw visible nodes)

    Shortcuts?
    Undo
    Improve the guide on how to use
    

FPGA Gates:
  String from memory and string to memory are "banned". Maybe look into restoring their functionality.

  Maybe add the various "luxuries" that e2 have (changed and last notably)
  Should these have wildcard types? 
  (this is pretty fucking hard???)
