FPGA Entity:
  Features:
    Branching
    Only trigger if output changed (is this possible?)
    2 inputs with same name should just share input point
    Timed empty gate
    Add options to editor

  Bugs:
    Superjaja focus bug
  

FPGA Tool:
  FPGA Editor:
    Features:  


FPGA Gates:
  Add CPU related gates (PC, various ALUs, ADDERS, etc)
    Full ALU? might be too much

FPGA Entity:
  Improve execution
  Optimize execution

  HiSpeed links (memory gates?)
    Wirelinks already work
    "Wrapper" fpga highspeed device?
      Define ranges that memory is routed through
      Or single values
      How to signify that a link is highspeed? Pseudo type?
      
  Add e2 commands that can find fpgas
      check performance use

  Bugs:
    (Entity spikes after amount of time and errors)
      Fixed by removing spike limit, as it seems unavoidable
      This is probably why E2 limits OPS and not time
    Sometimes average spikes (made average less harsh)

  Test:
    Check for errors during compilation (Hasnt been tested, but is implemented now)
      Check that gates exist
      Check for out of bounds input/output
      Type Check
      Check that connections are valid (that the destination node exists)
      Check if gate is banned..?


FPGA Tool:
  Be able to upload bigger than 64kb files

  FPGA Editor:
    Improve performance (only draw visible nodes)

    Shortcuts?
    Undo
    Improve the guide on how to use

    Feedback on writing wrong format (angle, vector)

    Bugs:
      Error if renaming open file, and trying to refresh


    

FPGA Gates:
  String from memory and string to memory are "banned". Maybe look into restoring their functionality.

  Maybe add the various "luxuries" that e2 have (changed and last notably)
  Should these have wildcard types? 
  (this is pretty fucking hard???)
