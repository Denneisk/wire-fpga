FPGA Entity:
  Features:
    Show more info (peak use, average use)
    Limit usage
    Check for errors during compilation

    Improve execution
    Optimize execution

    Loops dont work (memory output feeds into memory input)
      Update: Loops now get halted, but there should still be a way to make loops (last value gate?)
      Maybe add the various "luxuries" that e2 have (changed and last notably)
      Should these have wildcard types? 


FPGA Tool:
  Add a cool animation to the toolgun

  FPGA Editor:
    Features:
      Shortcuts?
      Grid
      Mark selection, move all gates (or delete all)
      copy paste (with compatible with selection)

    Bugs:
      Saving a file with capital letter fucks it up
      sometimes nodes cant be removed

    nice to have:
      remove data.UsedInputNames and data.UsedOutputNames from savedata, they can be inferred
      create input, rename, remove. name doesnt get freed up
