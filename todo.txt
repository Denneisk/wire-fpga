FPGA Entity:
  Features:
    Improve execution
    Optimize execution

    HiSpeed links (memory gates?)
    String to memory and opposite

    Add e2 commands that can find fpgas
      check performance use

  Bugs:
    
  Test:
    Check for errors during compilation (Hasnt been tested, but is implemented now)
      Check that gates exist
      Check for out of bounds input/output
      Type Check
      Check that connections are valid (that the destination node exists)
      Check if gate is banned..?

      Download from friend
      -Friends can upload

    Looping
      Execution chips have some edge cases (they dont retrigger on change as some might expect)



FPGA Tool:
  FPGA Editor:
    Features:
      Improve performance (only draw visible nodes)
      Fail better on loading wrong format files

    Bugs:
      sometimes nodes cant be removed
      cant create node on preopened tab
      chip name goes on the right side of execution interval
      extra frame on first tab created

    Feedback:
      Click outside of "E" menu should save
      Feedback on writing wrong format (angle, vector)

      Copying should copy from center


FPGA Gates:
  Add CPU related gates (PC, various ALUs, ADDERS, etc)

FPGA Entity:
  (Entity spikes after amount of time and errors)
      Fixed by removing spike limit, as it seems unavoidable
      This is probably why E2 limits OPS and not time.


FPGA Tool:
  Be able to upload bigger than 64kb files

  FPGA Editor:
    Bugs:
      Copying and pasting will fail if nodes are not sequential
    Shortcuts?
    Grid
    Undo
    Improve the guide on how to use


FPGA Gates:
  Maybe add the various "luxuries" that e2 have (changed and last notably)
  Should these have wildcard types? 
  (this is pretty fucking hard???)
