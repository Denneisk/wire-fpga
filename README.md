# Wire-FPGA

Adds a field programmable gate array for use with Wiremod (https://github.com/wiremod/wire)

Comes with a visual node editor, and offers a nice step inbetween pure gates and E2,
but also makes stuff like custom CPUs and other complicated gate devices possible, since the performance hit is several times lower than 
multiple gates being used to make the same device.
